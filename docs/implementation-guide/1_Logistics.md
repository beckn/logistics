# 1. Implementation Guide

This document contains the REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED standard functionality that must be implemented by any logistics service provider Platform a.k.a BPPs and logistics Consumer Platform a.k.a BAPs.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

## 1.1 Discovery of logistics service providers

### 1.1.1 Recommendations for BPPs
The following recommendations need to be considered when implementing discovery functionality for a logistics BPP

- REQUIRED. The BPP MUST implement the `search` endpoint to receive an `Intent` object sent by BAPs
- REQUIRED. The BPP MUST return a catalog of logistics services on the `on_search` callback endpoint specified in the `context.bap_uri` field of the `search` request body.
- REQUIRED. The BPP MUST map its logistics services to the `Item` schema.
- REQUIRED. Any logistics service provider related information like name, logo, short description must be mapped to the `Provider.descriptor` schema
- REQUIRED. Any form that must be filled before receiving a quotation must be mapped to the `XInput` schema
- REQUIRED. If the platform wants to group its services under a specific category, it must map each category to the `Category` schema
- REQUIRED. Any order fulfillment-related information MUST be mapped to the `Fulfillment` schema.
- REQUIRED. If the BPP does not want to respond to a search request, it MUST return a `ack.status` value equal to `NACK`
- RECOMMENDED. Upon receiving a `search` request, the BPP SHOULD return a catalog that best matches the intent. This can be done by indexing the catalog against the various probable paths in the `Intent` schema relevant to typical logistics use cases

### 1.1.2 Recommendations for BAPs
- REQUIRED. The BAP MUST call the `search` endpoint of the BG to discover multiple BPPs on a network
- REQUIRED. The BAP MUST implement the `on_search` endpoint to consume the `Catalog` objects containing logistics services sent by BPPs.
- REQUIRED. The BAP MUST expect multiple catalogs sent by the respective logistics service providers on the network
- REQUIRED. The logistics services can be found in the `Catalog.providers[].items[]` array in the `on_search` request
- REQUIRED. If the `catalog.providers[].items[].xinput` object is present, then the BAP MUST redirect the user to, or natively render the form present on the link specified on the `items[].xinput.form.url` field.
- REQUIRED. If the `catalog.providers[].items[].xinput.required` field is set to `"true"` , then the BAP MUST NOT fire a `select`, `init` or `confirm` call until the form is submitted and a successful response is received
- RECOMMENDED. If the `catalog.providers[].items[].xinput.required` field is set to `"false"` , then the BAP SHOULD allow the user to skip filling the form

- REQUIRED. The BPP MUST check for a form submission at the URL specified on the `xinput.form.url` before acknowledging a `select` request.
- REQUIRED. If the logistics service provider has successfully received the information submitted by the consumer, the BPP must return an acknowledgement with `ack.status` set to `ACK` in response to the `select` request
- REQUIRED. If the logistics service provider has returned a successful acknowledgement to a `select` request, it MUST send the offer encapsulated in an `Order` object

#### 1.2.1.2 Initializing a logistics service order
- REQUIRED. The BPP MUST implement the `init` endpoint on the url specified in  the `context.bpp_uri` field sent during `on_search`. In case of permissioned networks, this URL MUST match the `Subscriber.url` present on the respective entry in the Network Registry

### 1.2.2 Recommendations for BAPs

#### 1.2.1.1 Selecting a logistics service from the catalog
- REQUIRED. The BAP user MUST submit the form on the url received from  `on_search`  under `xinput.form.url`.
- REQUIRED. The BAP MUST implement the `on_select` endpoint on the url specified in the `context.bap_uri` field sent during `select`. In case of permissioned networks, this URL MUST match the `Subscriber.url` present on the respective entry in the Network Registry

#### 1.2.2.2  Initializing a logistics service order
- REQUIRED. The BAP MUST hit the `init` endpoint on the url specified in  the `context.bpp_uri` field sent during `on_search`. 
- REQUIRED. The BAP MUST implement the `on_init` endpoint on the url specified in  the `context.bap_uri` field sent during `init`. In case of permissioned networks, this URL MUST match the `Subscriber.url` present on the respective entry in the Network Registry

#### 1.2.2.3 Confirming the logistics service order
- REQUIRED. The BAP MUST hit the `confirm` endpoint on the url specified in  the `context.bpp_uri` field sent during `on_search`. 
- REQUIRED. The BAP MUST implement the `on_confirm` endpoint on the url specified in URL specified in the `context.bap_uri` field sent during `confirm`. In case of permissioned networks, this URL MUST match the `Subscriber.url` present on the respective entry in the Network Registry
